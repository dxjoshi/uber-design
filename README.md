#Ride Management Application    
You are responsible for the driver onboarding module.        

### Details:    
As part of this module you are required to build an interface that will allow a driver to sign-up as a driver partner. 
The driver onboarding module should:        
a) Allow a driver to sign-up and enter their profile information.            
b) Trigger onboarding processes like document collection, background verification, shipping of tracking device, etc.,           
c) Allow a driver to mark when they are ready to take a ride        

### TODO:   
Please create a list of the API interfaces you will expose to support these requirements and also come up with choices of data stores, tech stacks, etc.,       
Instructions to the candidate:
1. We are interested in your approach to the problem. It is alright if you donâ€™t have a beautiful PPT.           
2. You can even use pen/paper to draw your design and take a pic of that and share it as part of your craft demo.            
3. Do take the time to clearly define the data models and the API interfaces.
